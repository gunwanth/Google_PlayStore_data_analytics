# NullClass Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes app-related data using Python and Jupyter notebooks. It includes various analyses, visualizations, and dashboards related to app reviews, categories, and user interactions.

The main objective of this project is to gain insights from app store data, such as understanding user feedback, analyzing app categories, and identifying trends in the marketplace.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of raw app data.
- Interactive visualizations (choropleth maps, category graphs, dashboards) to provide better insights.
- Multiple Jupyter notebooks dedicated to different aspects of exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Statistical analysis and feature extraction from user reviews.
- Dashboard for quick visualization and interaction with processed data.
- Categorization and sentiment analysis to determine user perceptions.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning applications, if needed)
- Flask/Dash (for web-based dashboards)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nullclass_project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open any of the `.ipynb` files to explore the analysis.
6. For dashboard interaction, open `dashboard.html` in a web browser.

## Usage
- Open `Analysis.ipynb` to start exploring the dataset.
- Run `dashboard.html` for an interactive overview.
- Review processed data in `Cleaned_Play_Store_Data.csv` and `Cleaned_User_Reviews.csv`.
- Use `category_analysis.html` and `choropleth_map.html` for specific visual representations.
- Modify existing Jupyter notebooks to conduct custom analyses.

## Data Sources
The project makes use of data collected from the Google Play Store, including user reviews and app information. The cleaned versions of the datasets are stored in `Cleaned_Play_Store_Data.csv` and `Cleaned_User_Reviews.csv`.
